[h1]Permanent Buffs[/h1]

Permanent Buffs is a simple mod that allows the user better control over their buffs. This mod should be compatible with most other mods and does not change any behaviour unless the config options are enabled.

- Allows keeping buffs after death and after saving and quitting
- Option to selectively apply death persistence to station buffs so you don't have to click the stations every time you respawn.
- Option to permanently extend duration of all buffs
- Option to apply this mod to debuffs as well (why would you do this?)
- This mod is client side only

All the code is also on github if you want to edit the mod for your own preferences or take a look at how I coded anything.
